This project is still under development. There's a TON of moderation features and other sorts of features that I'm hoping to add.
The ultimate end-goal for this project is to replace moderation bots within Skyblock Maniacs. 
However, these features can be applied to any other server, and all code will be open-source unless it includes sensitive information.

That said, this project does not include a very important file: .env
In your coding software, be sure to create a .env file within the root of your project.
This file should have the following format:

TOKEN=<discord bot token>
GUILD_ID=<discord server id>
CLIENT_ID=<discord bot id>

If you're unsure how to set this up, I recommend this video: https://youtu.be/KZ3tIGHU314?si=LWP792yklc8Mb_Bm&t=1443
